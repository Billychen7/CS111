lab1a.c
Single C source module that compiles cleanly and can run without any options which converts terminal to non-canonical input mode with no echo
Or it can take in --shell=program which forks a new process and then execs the program given. Full duplex terminal and passes input and output between two processes

Testing Methodology
By running ./lab1a by itself we can test the non-canonical input mode with no echo
By running ./lab1a --shell="/bin/bash" we test the programs ability to pass input and output between two processes.
