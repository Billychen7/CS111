Description of included files

lab0.c
This single C source module takes in a standard input and outputs to a standard output using input/output redirection which essentially manipulates the file descriptors. The possible arguments that can be used in this code include --input, --output, --segfault, and --catch. The --input takes in an input file with --input=filename, specifying filename as the input. Similarly, --output takes in an output with --output=filename, specifying filename as the standard output file. --segfault flag forces a segmentation fault but setting a char pointer to NULL and then storing a value through the null pointer. --catch flag catches the segmentation fault by calling signal(2) so that it can catch SIGSEGV. --catch logss the error message.

Makefile
The Makefile builds the lab0 executable and also includes the -Wall and -Wextra. The check runs a smoke test to check lab0.c and determines if it runs successfully or not. The clean target then deletes all of the remaining file created in the Makefile including the lab0 executable. The dist target builds the tarball

backtrace.png
This is a screenshot of a gdb session which shows a segmentation fault and shows the associated stack-trace.

breakpoint.png
This is a screenshot of a gdb session which shows a breakpoint where the segmentation fault should occur nd using variable inspection showing that the pointer creted is NULL, causing  segmentation fault. 

README
Shows identification information, description of included files, and smoke test cases.

Smoke Test Cases
noArgTest
-checks for the correct exit code when no argument is passed or used

invalidArgTest
-check for correct exit code if invalid argument is passed

redirectTest
-checks correct results and exit code when given valid input and output options and determines if successful input/output redirection is performed

inputTest
-checks for correct exit code and error message if file does not exist but is still used in argument
-makes sure correct exit code and error message is passed if argument called without actual input
-makes sure for correct exit code and correct redirection given valid file and valid --input option

outputTest
- checking for error message when failing creat(2) because of invalid file without write permissions given as argument
- makes sure correct exit code and error message is passed if argument called without actual output 
- makes sure for correct exit code and correct redirection given valid file and valid --output option

catchTest
- check to make sure code returns correct exit code and error message for forced segmentation fault and correct catch.
