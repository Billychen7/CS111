# CS111-Operating-Systems
These are my solutions to CS 111, Operating Systems Principles, with Prof. Reiher in Spring 2020.

Skills shown in projects:

Project 0:
- demonstrate the ability to use basic POSIX file operations.
- demonstrate the ability to process command line arguments.
- introduce and demonstrate the ability to catch and handle run-time exceptions.
- demonstrate the ability to return informative exit status.
- demonstrate the ability to research and exploit non-trivial APIs.
- demonstrate the ability to write software that conforms to a Command Line Interface (CLI) specification.

Project 1A:
- Demonstrate the ability to research new APIs and debug code that exploits them
- Exploit the following OS features:
  - Terminal I/O and modes (as an example of a complex API set)
  - Polled I/O (a means of awaiting input from multiple sources)
  - Inter-process communication
  - Exception handling

Project 1B:
- Demonstrate ability to do network communication
- Demonstrate ability to do exploit a new library
- Develop multi-process debugging skills

Project 2A:
- Demonstrate the ability to recognize critical sections and address them with a variety of different mechanisms.
- Demonstrate the existence of race conditions, and efficacy of the subsequent solutions
- Experience with basic performance instrumentation, measurement and analysis

Project 2B:
- Demonstrate the ability to recognize bottlenecks on large data structures
- Experience with partitioning a serialized resource to improve parallelism
- Experience with basic performance measurement and instrumentation
- Experience with execution profiling
- Experience with finding, installing, and exploiting new development tools

Project 3A:
- Reinforce the basic file system concepts of directory objects, file objects, and free space.
- Reinforce the implemenation descriptions provided in the text and lectures.
- Experience researching, examining, interpreting and processing information in complex binary data structures.
- Experience with examining interpreted and raw hex dumps of complex data structures as a means of developing an understanding of those data structures.
- Practical experience with on-disk file system data formats.

Project 3B:
- Experience examining, interpreting and processing information in complex binary data structures.
- Reinforce the notions of consistency and integrity and apply them to a concrete and non-trivial problem.

Project 4B:
- Demonstrate the ability to design, build and debug interactive applications on an embedded system.
- Develop the ability to work with embedded system sensors and actuators through standard tool kits.
- Experience with the processing of digital and analog inputs on an embedded system.

Project 4C:
- Ability to design, build and debug an embedded application that interacts with a central control server with the aid of server-side logs.
- Ability to implement a secure channel using standard tools.
- Ability to research and exploit a complex API, and to debug an application involving encrypted communication.
